## Introduction

In the ever-evolving digital world, We are a freelance platform empowering the people of Karnataka who carry the cultural and traditional roots.

"Namma" in the name translated to "our" in Kannada. In essence, we wish to showcase the people of Karnataka with their unique and beautiful artistic forms such as dancers, musicians, singers, various handicrafts, etc. offer their services on our platform. The services can include workshops or events in which people can embrace the art forms. People can post Gigs to these freelancers.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites:
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the Git repository.

2. **Navigate to Client and Server Directories:**
   - Navigate into the cloned repository folder:
     ```
     cd Namma-Freelance
     ```
   - Navigate to the client directory:
     ```
     cd client
     ```
   - Navigate to the server directory:
     ```
     cd ../server
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Inside both the client and server directories, install the necessary dependencies by running:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start the Server:**
   - Start the Node.js server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   This will start the server locally on a specified port.

5. **Start the Client:**
   - Navigate back to the client directory:
     ```
     cd ../client
     ```
   - Start the React client:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   This will start the React application and automatically open it in your default web browser.

6. **View the Application:**
   - Once both the server and client are running, you should be able to view the application in your web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Now you have the **Namma-Freelance** application running locally on your machine, with the server and client communicating as expected. You can now explore and interact with the application as needed for development or testing purposes.
